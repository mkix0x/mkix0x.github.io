      <description>You need confidence and a proven track record to finish games constantly. Start with small projects to build your skills.
To avoid feeling overwhelmed and stay on track, break your game down into achievable high-level milestones.
Prioritize important outcomes for each milestone and focus on progress, rather than details.
Striving for perfection can hinder your progress. Aim for &amp;ldquo;good enough&amp;rdquo; results instead.
Improve your finishing skills and perseverance. With each milestone and finished project, your confidence will grow.</description>

      <description>Masahiro Sakurai published a video where he mentioned that rewards should be the first thing you consider. However, this videos lacks cruicial information.
Yes, you should consider rewards, but to do that you need to know what your risks are. It&amp;rsquo;s possible that you don&amp;rsquo;t have awareness what rewards truly are. Put simply, rewards exist to mitigate risks. If a reward doesn&amp;rsquo;t reduce a risk, then it&amp;rsquo;s not a reward.</description>
