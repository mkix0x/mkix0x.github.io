      <description>Build your skills before building your game. You need confidence and a proven track record of completing projects, so start small and work your way up.
Avoid getting overwhelmed or directionless by planning your project thoroughly and breaking it down into achievable goals. This will keep you on track and prevent setbacks.
Identify the most important tasks and prioritize them. This will help you make progress quickly and avoid getting bogged down in less important details.</description>

      <description>Masahiro Sakurai published a video where he mentioned that rewards should be the first thing you consider. However, this videos lacks cruicial information.
Yes, you should consider rewards, but to do that you need to know what your risks are. It&amp;rsquo;s possible that you don&amp;rsquo;t have awareness what rewards truly are. Put simply, rewards exist to mitigate risks. If a reward doesn&amp;rsquo;t reduce a risk, then it&amp;rsquo;s not a reward.</description>
